#   Purpose: Recreate Section of Nytelock Digital
    The task was to recreate a specific section from the Nytelock Digital website.
    Samples were provided in a screenshot & video sent for me to review. Both Design and functionality were to be replicated successfully. 

##   Frontend Framework used:
    The frontend framework used for this project was React.js.

##   HTML:
    HTML were written in functions. This was used to create the layout of the page.

##   CSS:
    CSS was used to style the page. Examples include: i.e. hover, color, height, width, and more for given elements.
   
##   There are two components I created: 
    1. Navbar.js (The navbar replicated per the samples)
    2. Header.js (Which was the section that had the most functionality)

##   Global Links:
    This section is commented out in the Public directory to prove knowledge of
    linking global elements for Fontfamily styles, for example.

##   Github:
    Used, linked, git to my Github to show evidence that I have the knowledge to push
    repositories, set up pull-requests, provide necessary comment -m " " to provide
    an organized history of events for others to read and keep track of; This creates an organized, and successful team environments. With organized repositories I believe it helps the entire team avoid confusion, misunderstanding and most importantly crucial errors that might set the team back on a given project.

##   Comments:
    Sections are properly commented out for organization purposes. This creates easy to read and keep track of the code. Seperated github branches for tracking purposes.
    
##   Organizatilon
    Divs are properly aligned and sectioned. CSS is put in alphabetized order for better readability.

##   NPM:
    Npm, nodes, bootstrap were all installed in the terminal for built in library purposes.
