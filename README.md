#   Purpose: Recreate Section of Nytelock Digital
    The task was to recreate a specific section from the Nytelock Digital website.
    Samples were provided in a screenshot & video sent for me to review. Both Design and functionality were to be replicated successfully. 

##   Frontend Framework used:
    The frontend framework used for this project was React.js. This includes HTML inside of functions, creating the layout of the page. CSS was used to style the page. Examples include: i.e. hover, color, height, width, and more for given elements.
   
##   There are two components I created: 
    1. Navbar.js (The navbar replicated per the samples)
    2. Header.js (Which was the section that had the most functionality)

##   Global Links:
    This section is commented out in the Public directory to prove knowledge of
    linking global elements for Fontfamily styles, for example.

##   Github:
    Used, linked, git to my Github to show evidence that I have the knowledge to push
    repositories, set up pull-requests, provide necessary comment -m " " to provide
    an organized history of events for others to read and keep track of; This creates an organized, and successful team environments. With organized repositories I believe it helps the entire team avoid confusion, misunderstanding and most importantly crucial errors that might set the team back on a given project.

    
##   Organizatilon
    Divs are properly aligned and sectioned. CSS is put in alphabetized order for better readability. Sections are properly commented out for organization purposes. This creates easy to read and keep track of the code. Seperated github branches for tracking purposes.

##   Starting Project and installing libraries:
    To start:

    (npx create-react-app my-app) - build project in the terminal


    Run Porject:

    (npm start) - write in terminal to run project in a local host.

    This runs an arbitrary command specified in the package's "start" property of its "scripts" object. If no "start" property is specified on the "scripts" object, it will run node server.js.
